	<p>The style guide is built using <a href="http://warpspire.com/kss/" target="_blank"><strong>Knyle Style Sheets</strong></a>. KSS focuses on how people work with CSS â€” it does not define code structures, naming conventions, or methods for abstraction. It is important to understand that the styleguide format and documentation format are intrinsically tied to one another.</p>
	<p>Because we use CSS preprocessors, the following format is used as a guideline when creating or modifying KSS documentation:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
<code data-language="scss">
// A button suitable for giving stars to someone.
//
// :hover             - Subtle hover highlight.
// .stars-given       - A highlight indicating you've already given a star.
// .stars-given:hover - Subtle hover highlight on top of stars-given styling.
// .disabled          - Dims the button to indicate it cannot be used.
//
// Styleguide Elements - Buttons

a.button.star{
  ...
  &.star-given{
    ...
  }
  &.disabled{
    ...
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
	<p>All documentation comments can be found throughout the various SCSS partials for the project.</p>
	<p><strong>It is strongly recommended to constantly document any development that involves UI elements of any sort.</strong></p>
