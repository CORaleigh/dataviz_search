##Sprint 1: Search Data Conceptualization and Prioritization; Low-Fi Wireframe Testing##
##Sprint 2: Low Fidelity Layout and Visualization Concepts for 5 Search Stories##

###Goals of Sprint 1###

* Identify key targeted user segments and validate the intentions of these users behind the search keywords in top 10 Search Stories (defined as clusters/use cases of similar search keywords). 
* Answer the questions: What info are people looking for? Why are they looking for it? How do people categorize types of civic information (mental models/vocab)?
* Prioritize/Discover what data or information is most important to receive, both the most intriguing and most relevant or useful for each use case (top 10)

After Sprint 1, City of Raleigh will narrow the number of Search Stories to test from 10 to 5.

###Goals of Sprint 2###
Understand what data visualization concepts and combinations of prioritized data (selected from Sprint 1 prioritization exercises) are most (a) comprehensible and (b) appealing to the user for each Search Story. In other words, the offeror shall validate preferences of basic layout (everything under the search bar) and specific combinations of data visualization options. 

Who to test: 
Targeted Users who have used search on the website. Note that the City of Raleigh will be collecting a small pool of targeted users throughout Feb-March.
Non-targeted users (n=>15 per Search Story). Note: At least 50% of testing should consider mobile device layouts.

Suggested Testing Methodologies - One or both of following methods (Note: The emphasis of Sprint 2 is low fidelity testing).

*	Online Survey with feature-ranking functionality (n target = 80 with at least 15 users per Search Story)
* Remote or In-Person Interviews (n target = minimum of 6-8 total with at least 3 users providing perspective on each of the 10 Search Stories) 
** Paper Model layouts ranking
*	Primarily remote A/B or A/B/C test of low fidelity clickable wireframes for each Search Story (n=>10 per Search Story)
*	Possible Method: Link from popup on raleighnc.gov or search results; possibly other participating city websites
